1. Key Terms Related to Databases:

Database: A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored electronically in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, retrieve, and update information.

Table: In the context of databases, a table is a collection of related data organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute or field of the data.

Record: A record, also known as a row, is a single instance or entry in a database table. It contains a set of related data values representing an entity, such as a person, product, or transaction.

Field: A field, also known as a column, is a single data element within a database table. It represents a specific attribute or characteristic of the data being stored, such as a person's name, product price, or transaction date.

Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed. Typically, primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity and establish relationships between tables.

SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and defining database structures.

Query: A query is a request for information from a database. It is typically written in SQL and used to retrieve specific data based on specified criteria or conditions.

Index: An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It is created on one or more columns of a table and allows for faster searching, sorting, and filtering of data.

Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them to improve data integrity and minimize data anomalies.

Database Management System (DBMS): A DBMS is software that provides an interface for users to interact with a database. It includes tools and utilities for creating, accessing, managing, and manipulating databases. Examples of DBMSs include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

2. Discussions:

2.1.1. Purpose of a Primary Key: The primary key in a database table uniquely identifies each record within the table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed, facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation. For example, in a table storing employee data, the EmployeeID column could serve as the primary key, guaranteeing that each employee record has a distinct identifier.

2.1.2. Difference Between DBMS and Database: A database is a structured collection of data, while a database management system (DBMS) is software used to manage and interact with databases. Essentially, a DBMS provides the tools and utilities for creating, accessing, managing, and manipulating databases. Without a DBMS, it would be challenging to efficiently organize, store, and retrieve data from a database.

2.1.3. Importance of Normalization: Normalization is crucial in database design as it helps improve data integrity and reduce data redundancy. By organizing data into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them, normalization minimizes the risk of data anomalies such as update anomalies, insertion anomalies, and deletion anomalies. For example, in a database storing customer and order information, normalization would involve dividing the data into separate tables for customers and orders, linked by a common customer identifier. This approach ensures that each piece of data is stored only once and avoids inconsistencies or duplications.
