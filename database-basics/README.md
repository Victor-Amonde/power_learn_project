# Database Design & Programming with SQL

This course engages students to analyze complex business scenarios and create a data model—a conceptual representation of an organization’s information. Participants implement their database design by creating a physical database using SQL. Basic SQL syntax and the rules for constructing valid SQL statements are reviewed. This course culminates with a project that challenges students to design, implement, and demonstrate a database solution for a business or organization.
